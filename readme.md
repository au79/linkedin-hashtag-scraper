# LinkedIn Hashtag Scraper

## Quickstart

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Then open a browser window at `http://localhost:3000`.

You'll need your LinkedIn session cookie, so log in there, and look for the cookie with the key `li_at`.  Copy its value into the form.

The next page will allow you to search for hashtags.  Do not include the `#` in the search form.
